/* Ethernet MAC and on-chip 100M PHY, bridged to lwip.
 *
 * The MAC is a Synopsys DWMAC -- the same IP STM32F4/F7 carry -- so the
 * register names, the 4-word chained descriptors and the overall shape of this
 * driver match ports/stm32/eth.c. What follows documents only where the CH32
 * differs, because those are the parts no STM32 reference will tell you.
 *
 * WCH's own driver for this part is EVT/EXAM/ETH/NetLib/eth_driver_100M.c,
 * paired with a precompiled libwchnet.a. The library is lwip with WCH's socket
 * API on top; MicroPython already vendors lwip, so only the hardware knowledge
 * below is taken from it. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-ch32-ethernet-design.md.
 *
 * Four CH32-specific facts drive this file:
 *
 * 1. The PHY is ON-CHIP. Its MDI pins go straight to the RJ45 and reference
 *    manual table 31-1 lists them as "No IO configuration required" -- there is
 *    no RMII pin muxing to do, unlike every STM32 board. It answers on SMI
 *    address 1.
 * 2. It needs its own PLL: RCC_CTLR bit 26 ETH_PLLON, ready on bit 27.
 * 3. It is held in reset and powered down out of cold boot, by MACPHYCR
 *    bits 31 and 30.
 * 4. There is an undocumented analog trim that must be reapplied on every
 *    link-up. See eth_phy_para_cfg().
